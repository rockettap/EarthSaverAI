# 🌍 EarthSaverAI ❄️ 
 
**Web-Based Information System for Sea Ice Extent Forecasting**

**EarthSaverAI** is an interactive, web-based forecasting and visualization platform for analyzing **sea ice extent** in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions. By combining **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **classical statistical methods**, EarthSaverAI delivers forecasts up to the year 2100 with a focus on **interpretability** and **regional comparison**.

## 🌱 Supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

EarthSaverAI contributes directly to the following United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:

### 🎯 SDG 13 – *Climate Action*
- Forecasting long-term trends in polar ice melt helps mitigate climate risks and supports evidence-based climate policies.
- Empowers researchers, governments, and the public to understand and act on climate-related data.

### 🌊 SDG 14 – *Life Below Water*
- Sea ice loss affects marine ecosystems, biodiversity, and fisheries.
- EarthSaverAI provides essential data for assessing impacts on ocean circulation, temperature, and habitat in polar waters.

### 🌳 SDG 15 – *Life on Land*
- Coastal ice and snow changes affect terrestrial ecosystems and Arctic wildlife.
- Visualizing historical and predicted melt trends supports ecosystem conservation and resilience planning for vulnerable regions.

> By fostering transparency and access to climate modeling tools, EarthSaverAI contributes to a global understanding of environmental change and supports collective climate action.
